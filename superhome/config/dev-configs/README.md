# Dev Configurations

Personal dev configurations for different projects.

These configuration files are not stored in the project's version control because it's specific to my workflow, and clutters things.
Instead they are stored here to sync between home/work/other computers easily.

Example configurations are vscode project-specific settings (`.vscode/`), and vim settings (`.vim/`, `.vimspector.json`).
