cd alias folders notes

Wanted to cd into mac's alias folders.

The file `getTrueName.c`, which I got from above link, or directly here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20100110234300/http://www.macosxhints.com/dlfiles/getTrueName.txt
is for getting the path of a directory an alias points to.

Compiled it:
`gcc -o getTrueName -framework Carbon getTrueName.c`

But a few of the function it uses are deprecated, so I don't trust it.

It's purpose was to get receive the alias directory as an argument, and ouput the POSIX path to the directory it points to.

I found this as an alternative:

found from here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1175094/os-x-terminal-command-to-resolve-path-of-an-alias

Cloned the directory called `aliasPath`.
Cd in and Compiled with `sudo xcodebuild install`.
This creates `/usr/local/bin/aliasPath`.

Then in `~/.zshrc` I created a function modified from top link.
It's called `cda` for `cd alias`.
This gets the true path of the argument (expected to be an alias), and calls cd on the true path.
Since calling `cd ..` doesn't get you back to where you were. I have `cda` set a variable `back` to the `pwd`.
Then I created another function `cdback` which cd's into the value of `back` varaible.
